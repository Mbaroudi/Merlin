1. Flow Routing:
    - flow orchestration
    - conditional job execution
    - error handling
    - interfaces to monitor the executions, etc.
2. Flow Scheduler:
    - time-based scheduling
    - real-time scheduling based on external, unpredictable events
    - automatic restart and recovery in event of failures
3. Docker container:
    - use docker container to package and ship frameworks
    - use docker containers to deploy and run job flows
4. Vagrant configurations to simplify flow development and testing
